    <div>
        <h3 class="description"><strong>TETRAX</strong> launched operations in Lebanon in 2015 with a dedicated and
            highly experienced
            management team to
            provide industries with the best-fit packaging for their needs. The company primarily served the Lebanese
            and Moroccan markets with flexible packaging films, providing its customers with the best consultation
            services along with a competitive advantage in the field.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="description"> As of 2017, <strong>TETRAX</strong> provided services to more than 20 African countries
            and had a permanent sales presence in
            both East and West Africa.</h3>
        <h3 class="description">
            In 2020, the company relocated its head offices to Dubai, UAE, and began expanding its services to include
            machine consultancy and supply, in addition to turnkey projects, with the assistance of a professional team
            of engineers.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="description">
            By 2022, <strong>TETRAX</strong> had identified a need to assist several African countries in exporting
            their products, when
            another unit was created to approach and make liaisons with global markets in terms of sales and logistics
            executing and facilitating the export process.
            <strong>TETRAX</strong> will look for every opportunity to contribute to, develop, and improve the
            communities in which it
            operates in its countries of presence.
